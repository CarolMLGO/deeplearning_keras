# deeplearning_keras
Deep learning is a group of exciting new technologies for neural networks. Through a combination of advanced training techniques and neural network architectural components, it is now possible to create neural networks of much greater complexity. Deep learning allows a neural network to learn hierarchies of information in a way that is like the function of the human brain. This course will introduce the student to computer vision with Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), time series analysis with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), classic neural network structures and application to computer security. High Performance Computing (HPC) aspects will demonstrate how deep learning can be leveraged both on graphical processing units (GPUs), as well as grids. Focus is primarily upon the application of deep learning to problems, with some introduction mathematical foundations. Students will use the Python programming language to implement deep learning using Google TensorFlow and Keras.
